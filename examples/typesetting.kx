doc.abstract(%{
This system is a small typesetting system written in Kinx.
Most of people knows the \LaTeX\footnote{Leslie Lamport, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX} is being used for that purpose,
but the \TeX\footnote{Donald E. Knuth, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX} system is very huge.
This system provides only a limited functionality,
but supports some of \TeX algorithms in this small system.
This would be your best partner as long as used for your personal use.

    Kinx TT has supported some kind of \TeX algorithms, so the final output would be pretty beautiful.
    You can check it yourself as this document was generated by this system.
    On the other hand, there are some known bad points below as a trade off.

    The figure on the right is an example of hyphenation and justification.
    Hyphenation will be done before applying line-breaking algorithm.
    The algorithm is based on \monotype{Hyper.js},

});
doc.paragraph(%{
    And also, this system is supporting \bold{Knuth-Plass Line Breaking Algorithm} for line-break.

    Widows and orphans control is not perfect so far.

    Please check it and you can use \monotype{\\pagebreak} command anywhere you need.
